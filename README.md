CPE-SLDI
===============================
An implementation of CPE-SLDI, a new model for predicting coding potential.

Reference
========================
Our manuscipt titled with "Predicting Coding Potential of RNA Sequences by Solving Local Data Imbalance" is being reviewed by IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics.

Requirements
========================
    [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Usage
========================
python CPE.py


Data
=====================
In this work, we use the datasets organized by CPPred.
Human-Training: coding RNAs(33360,117M)+ noncoding RNAs(24163,24M)
Human-Testing: 8557 coding RNAs+ 8241 noncoding RNAs
Human-sORF-Testing: 641 coding RNAs+ 641 noncoding RNAs
Mouse-Testing: 31102 coding RNAs+ 19930 noncoding RNAs
Mouse-sORF-Testing: 846 coding RNAs+ 1000 noncoding RNAs
